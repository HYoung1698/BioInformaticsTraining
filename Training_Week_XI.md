Do collapse first and deduplicate then.
picard vs samtool rmdup: picard for DNA .

Single end vs paired end plz dedup. For those with dup more than 80%, drop this case. 

Preampilification can generate dup, which could be ignorant. 

Small RNA lib has low complexity. 

Cannot tell dup whether is made by PCR or originally exist
